## How to Build and Operate a HART-IP Flow Device on a Raspberry Pi Computer

Follow the instructions in these guides to build and operate your device:

* [Read the Flow Device Specification](https://github.com/FieldCommGroup/HART-IP-Developer-Kit/blob/master/doc/HART-IP%20FlowDevice%20Spec.md)
* [Purchase your parts using the Bill of Materials](https://github.com/FieldCommGroup/HART-IP-Developer-Kit/blob/master/doc/Bill%20of%20Materials.md)
* [Install an operating system on your Pi Device](https://github.com/FieldCommGroup/HART-IP-Developer-Kit/blob/master/doc/Install%20OS.md)
* [Configure the Flow Device software on the Pi](https://github.com/FieldCommGroup/HART-IP-Developer-Kit/blob/master/doc/Configure%20the%20Flow%20Device.md)
* [Operate the Flow Device](https://github.com/FieldCommGroup/HART-IP-Developer-Kit/blob/master/doc/Operate%20the%20Flow%20Device.md)
* [Connect a client to the device](https://github.com/FieldCommGroup/HART-IP-Developer-Kit/blob/master/doc/Connect%20a%20Client.md)
