| [Windows HART-IP Client](https://github.com/FieldCommGroup/WindowsHartIpClient) | Construct and send HART messages to a HART-IP device. Parse the responses. Subscribe to published messages. C\# project with user interface, UDP/TCP connection components and installer.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [hipserver](https://github.com/FieldCommGroup/hipserver)                        | Use this project to simplify the development of your own server application of HART-IP device. This component is shared by all FieldComm Group HART-IP server implementations, including the latest HART Test System. It manages IP connections, publishing messages to multiple clients and more. C++ project for Ubuntu operating systems 12 and later. |
| [hipflow](https://github.com/FieldCommGroup/hipflow)                                                                   | This example HART device application, together with the hipserver component, implements a functioning, native HART-IP device. This example is tailored for Raspberry Pi 3B+ or later. C++ project for Ubuntu 18.04 or later.                                                                                                                              |
